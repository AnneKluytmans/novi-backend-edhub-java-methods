# Methods Practice â€“ NOVI Backend Module Assignment

## About the Project

This repository contains my solutions for the **Methods Practice** assignment from the Backend Development module at [Novi University](https://www.novi.nl).

The goal of this project is to practice writing Java methods with and without parameters and return values. The assignment is divided into three parts to gradually build up understanding of method structure, parameter handling, and return types.
